# MedicalAppointment
This project was implemented using an MLP model to predict whether a patient will attend for their appointment or not.
The dataset contained some information about patients, including their age, gender, appointment date and etc, and if they attented their appointment or not. I trained my MLP model on this data with aim to predict if a potential patient will attend their appointment or not.
This project was implemented using Pytorch specifically. Moreover, data visualization and evaluation graphs are provided in the project report for better understanding.
